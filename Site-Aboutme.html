                    <p class="content">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

                    <p class="content"><spare style="font-weight: bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</spare> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                    <p class="content">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
                    <h3 class="subtitlu2">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                    <p class="content">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. </p>
                    <p class="content">With how much it turned my life around,<spare style="font-weight: bold"> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</spare>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
